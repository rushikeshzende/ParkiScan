# **🧠 Overview**

ParkiScan is an AI-based system designed to identify early signs of Parkinson’s disease using non-invasive data such as speech and movement patterns. Parkinson’s often begins with subtle changes that go unnoticed in routine checkups, making early detection difficult. ParkiScan focuses on capturing and analyzing these early signals through intelligent data modeling rather than relying solely on visible clinical symptoms.

By combining signal processing with machine learning and deep learning techniques, ParkiScan transforms raw human signals into meaningful indicators of neurological health. The system is built to be flexible, allowing it to work with voice data, motor signals, or a combination of both.

# **🎯 The Problem ParkiScan Solves**

Parkinson’s disease is usually diagnosed only after clear motor symptoms appear, when significant neurological damage has already occurred. Traditional diagnosis depends heavily on specialist evaluation, which can be subjective, expensive, and difficult to scale for early screening.

There is a growing need for tools that can flag potential risk earlier, in a way that is objective, accessible, and non-invasive. ParkiScan addresses this need by using AI to detect subtle signal-level changes that humans cannot reliably observe but machines can learn to recognize.

# **💡 What Makes ParkiScan Different**

Uses non-invasive data such as voice or movement patterns

Focuses on early-stage indicators, not late symptoms

Applies both classical ML and deep learning for balanced performance

Designed as a modular and extensible system, not a one-off model

Built with real-world screening and future clinical use in mind

# **🚀 Impact & Vision**

ParkiScan is intended as an early screening and decision-support tool—not a replacement for medical professionals. Its long-term vision is to support clinicians, researchers, and healthcare systems by enabling faster, more objective identification of Parkinson’s risk, opening the door to earlier intervention and better patient outcomes.
